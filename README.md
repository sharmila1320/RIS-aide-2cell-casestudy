# Objective of Case Study
Simulate and analyze how an RIS placed between two neighboring cells can:

Boost signal for a user

Control inter-cell interference

Show SNR improvement for optimized RIS vs random/no RIS
 #System Layout
ðŸ“¡ BS1 at (0, 0)

ðŸ“¡ BS2 at (20, 0)

ðŸ‘¤ User U1 at (5, 0) served by BS1

ðŸ‘¤ User U2 at (15, 0) served by BS2

ðŸ§± RIS at (10, 0) between the two cells

RIS has N = 16 elements
